# rc-quadcopter-project
An independent, student built quadcopter designed for learning drone electronics, CAD, and flight control systems.

## This repository documents my personal engineering project, designing and building a radio controlled quadcopter from scratch

## Project Goals
- Learn drone electronics and flight control systems
- Develop CAD skills by designing and modeling drone body
- Integrate hardware and software into a functioning system
- Document Engineering and design decisions

## What's Included
- CAD Files
- Wiring Diagrams
- Iterations
- Photos/Videos of the build process

## Tools and Technology
- CAD: Onshape
- Flight Controller and BetaFlight Configurator
- Motors and ESC's
- RC transmitter and receiver

## Why this project matters
This project helped me develop hands-on skills in wiring, hardware+software integrations and engineering design.
